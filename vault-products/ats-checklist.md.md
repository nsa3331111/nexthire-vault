# ATS Optimization Checklist 2025

## Resume Format
- [ ] Use standard fonts **(Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman, Verdana; minimum 10pt for readability)**
- [ ] Save as both **.docx and .pdf** *(check job app instructionsâ€”many ATS ONLY parse .docx correctly)*
- [ ] Use standard section headings **(Professional Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications)**
- [ ] **Embed keywords** from job description **exactly** (including preferred/required technologies, methods, and soft skills)
- [ ] **Keep formatting very simple** (NO tables, columns, graphics, images, icons, charts, shapes, watermarks)
- [ ] **Left-align all text**â€”avoid center and right justification for main content
- [ ] **No information in headers, footers, or sidebars**â€”ATS may skip entirely

## Content Requirements  
- [ ] Include **phone** and *professional* email (never use work email)
- [ ] Use **bullet points for achievements** (avoid paragraph-style lists)
- [ ] **Quantify results**â€”metrics, numbers, %, KPIs, business impact (every bullet if possible)
- [ ] Include a **skills section** (hard and soft skills aligned to target job description)
- [ ] Mirror **job description language** for titles, tools, and responsibilities
- [ ] **1-2 pages max**: 1 page for <10 years experience; up to 2 pages for senior/lead roles
- [ ] Use your **full legal name** (matching LinkedIn/job application records)

## ATS-Friendly Structure
- [ ] **Contact info at top** (name, phone, email, LinkedIn [or portfolio], city/state/country if relevant)
- [ ] **Professional summary** (3-4 lines, punchy, with quantifiable metrics and keywords)
- [ ] **Work experience** chronologicalâ€”most recent first (company, title, dates MM/YYYY, city/state/country)
- [ ] **Education** next (degree, institution, grad date)
- [ ] **Skills section** (order and phrasing match target role)
- [ ] **No text in headers/footers/text boxes/graphics**
- [ ] [Optional] **Certifications section** (spell out full names, include dates)

## Extra 2025 Best Practices
- [ ] Avoid abbreviationsâ€”**spell out first, add abbreviation in parentheses** if also used in job description ("JavaScript (JS)")
- [ ] Use **regional date format** for target geography (US: MM/YYYY; EU: YYYY-MM or Month YYYY)
- [ ] Double-check for **typos/consistency** (section titles, bullets, verb tenses, spacing)
- [ ] **LinkedIn/Portfolio URL** as plain text (no icons/hyperlinks!)
- [ ] Use **active verbs**: "Led," "Delivered," "Transformed," "Optimized," etc.
- [ ] [Optional] **Awards/Honors**â€”brief, if relevant to target role
- [ ] [Optional] **Languages**â€”if relevant to job or region

## Pre-Submission Testing
- [ ] Run through **ATS simulator** (Jobscan, ResumeWorded, SkillSyncer)
- [ ] **Check keyword density** and section parsing
- [ ] **Verify all sections appear** (contact, summary, experience, skills, education, etc.)
- [ ] **Confirm contact info is parsed** and displays correctly in ATS preview

## ðŸŸ¢ Pro Tips
- [ ] Always tailor for each jobâ€”**one-size-fits-all resumes are less effective**
- [ ] **Check job posting for specific ATS or format notes**
- [ ] Keep a master versionâ€”then generate individual, job-specific resumes from it
